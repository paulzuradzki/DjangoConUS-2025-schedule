SUMMARY:Django for AI: Deploying Machine Learning Models with Django
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Will Vincent\nLocation: Sauganash Ballroom\n\nDes
 cription:\nIn this talk\, we'll bridge the gap between AI/data science and
  web development by demonstrating how to first train and then deploy a mac
 hine learning model using Django. Starting with the classic Iris dataset\,
  we'll walk through training a classification model with scikit-learn\, co
 vering key steps like data preprocessing\, model selection\, and evaluatio
 n.\n\nOnce the model is trained\, we'll shift focus to Django\, showcasing
  how to integrate the model into a web application that allows users to in
 put flower measurements and receive real-time predictions of the Iris spec
 ies.\n\nYou'll learn how to take a data science project from a Jupyter not
 ebook to a fully functional Django web app in just a few steps. Whether yo
 u're a data scientist interested in web deployment or a Django developer e
 xploring machine learning\, this talk will equip you with the tools to bri
 ng machine learning models into production-ready applications.\n\nMore inf

SUMMARY:Easy\, Breezy\, Beautiful... Django Unit Tests
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Colleen Dunlap\nLocation: Wolf Point Ballroom\n\n
 Description:\nWe‚Äôve all been in a situation where test coverage was lack
 ing. And unless you‚Äôve been very lucky\, we‚Äôve all seen a situation wh
 ere that lack of coverage led to bugs sneaking into production. With the c
 omplex backend and full-stack systems of today\, it is unrealistic to expe
 ct any programmer to know exactly how a code change will affect all parts 
 of the project. And we don‚Äôt have to! That‚Äôs why we have testing. And 
 unit tests are the most accessible form of testing throughout the entire d
 evelopment process ‚Äî it‚Äôs accessible right there in your terminal with
  a simple ‚Äúpytest‚Äù or ‚Äúmake tests‚Äù. Unit tests are the first line 
 of defense against bugs and breaks ‚Äî let‚Äôs ensure you have a strong\, 
 reliable Alexander the Great of unit test suites and not a temperamental\,
  vulnerable Achilles Heel!\n\nThis talk is divided into two parts.\n\nPart
  One: Unit Testing Why\, What and How ‚Äî These topics will be called back
  to in Part Two when we talk about Django specific unit testing features.\
 n\nPart Two: Write Tests WITH Django not AGAINST Django\n\nWriting Code is
  better when your testing is better. Do yourself a favor and send your uni
 t test skills to bootcamp!\n\nMore info: https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/e

SUMMARY:Django Governance: üå±Growing Sustainable Open-Source Communities 
 Togetherü§ù
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Rachell Calhoun\, Tim Schilling\nLocation: Saugan
 ash Ballroom\n\nDescription:\n"Come for the language\, stay for the commun
 ity." This is a mantra of Python communities\, including Django. It's clea
 r how easy it is to forge a strong bond with people in our communities. Bu
 t have you noticed when you solve one problem for the community\, you're s
 oon asked to help with two more problems? You might have even noticed that
  this phenomenon seems to never stop either. As long as you have time and 
 energy\, you're welcomed to do more and more for the community.\n\nOur com
 munities and our contributors need boundaries. Open source software govern
 ance is one way to help raise those boundaries. Rachell and Tim want to sh
 are with you their lessons learned from their time as open source contribu
 tors and community organizers in various organizations in the Django commu
 nity. Leaving this talk you will understand why governance is important to
  think about from the start\, how to define a basic governance structure a
 nd how to integrate it into an existing community. Our goal is to raise aw
 areness around the need for clearer expectations so people feel more confi
 dent contributing and feel less guilty when they can't.\n\nMore info: http

SUMMARY:Deploy Django: GitOps & Kubernetes Made Easy
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Calvin Hendryx-Parker\nLocation: Sauganash Ballro
 om\n\nDescription:\nThis talk will show attendees how to streamline the da
 y two operations of delivering and maintaining Python applications in prod
 uction environments. It emphasizes GitOps principles\, repeatable CI/CD wo
 rkflows\, and cloud-agnostic deployment using Kubernetes and Argo CD.\n\nD
 eploying code shouldn‚Äôt be stressful. But too often\, the journey from l
 ocal dev to production is fragile\, manual\, and hard to debug. This talk 
 is about building peace of mind into your pipeline ‚Äî with GitOps\, Kuber
 netes\, and open source tools like Argo CD that make continuous delivery p
 redictable\, repeatable\, and scalable from the very first release to the 
 50th.\n\nWe‚Äôll tackle the realities of ‚Äúday two‚Äù DevOps ‚Äî what hap
 pens after the first deploy. From managing rollbacks and coordinating rele
 ases to enforcing consistency across dev\, staging\, and production\, you
 ‚Äôll learn how to bring stability and scalability to your delivery pipeli
 ne.\n\nIn a live demo\, we‚Äôll deploy a full stack Django app from GitHub
  to production using Argo CD and GitHub Actions ‚Äî with observability\, r
 ollback strategies\, and environment parity built in from the start.\n\nYo
 u‚Äôll learn how to:\n\nWhether you're writing the code or leading the tea

SUMMARY:Building a Wagtail CMS Experience that Editors Love
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Michael Trythall\nLocation: Wolf Point Ballroom\n
 \nDescription:\nWhen a website redesign is on the horizon\, frustrations w
 ith the existing content management system (CMS) are often a major driver.
  Yet in many cases\, the root problem isn't the CMS itself\; it's how it w
 as implemented.\n\nWagtail CMS offers powerful tools for building rich\, f
 lexible content-driven websites\, but without careful planning and thought
 ful design\, even the best technology can lead to editor frustration.\n\nI
 n this talk\, we'll explore strategies and best practices for modeling con
 tent and design systems in Wagtail CMS that prioritize the needs of editor
 s and content teams. You'll learn how to structure StreamFields\, Pages\, 
 and Design Systems to create intuitive\, flexible\, and scalable editing e
 xperiences. We'll cover tips for creating governance and patterns that evo
 lve with a site over time\, so your Wagtail builds not only launch success
 fully but also thrive for years to come.\n\nWhether you're a Django develo
 per new to Wagtail or an experienced Wagtail user looking to level up your
  implementation skills\, this session will leave you with practical techni
 ques for building CMS experiences that editors love and that support Wagta
 il and Django‚Äôs continued success.\n\nMore info: https://2025.djangocon.

SUMMARY:Evolving Django: What We Learned by Integrating MongoDB
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Jeffrey A. Clark\nLocation: Wolf Point Ballroom\n
 \nDescription:\nBuilding on the progress of the past\, most notably django
 -mongodb-engine and django-nonrel\, MongoDB has taken on the challenge of 
 developing a production-ready Django database backend for MongoDB.\n\nEarl
 y in 2024 with help from Django core developer Tim Graham\, MongoDB has sy
 stematically developed and tested a database backend with the potential to
  be greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nIn September 2024\, I started wo
 rking for MongoDB to help with this project and what I've seen so far is a
 mazing! - Query support with MongoDB's aggregate function. - A custom mode
 l manager with raw_aggregate function to support MongoDB's QuerySet langua
 ge - Many more amazing things to be added between now and presentation! - 
 Released our beta we urge folks to try!\n\nAs a long time Django developer
  and newcomer to MongoDB\, I am excited about the possibilities. - An alte
 rnative to PostgreSQL and MySQL! - Deployments to MongoDB's Atlas cloud da
 tabase service. - Many more exciting things to be added between now and pr
 esentation!\n\nThank you and please check out https://github.com/mongodb-l

DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Efe √ñge\nLocation: Wolf Point Ballroom\n\nDescri
 ption:\nDjango‚Äôs migration framework is a powerful tool for evolving you
 r database schema\, but with great power comes great responsibility. In pr
 oduction systems\, the wrong migration at the wrong time can introduce ser
 ious performance issues or even temporary outages.\n\nThis talk demystifie
 s what actually happens during makemigrations\, migrate\, and sqlmigrate\,
  explains how Django interacts with the database engine\, and highlights t
 he locking behavior that can impact availability. Through real-world examp
 les\, we‚Äôll explore schema changes that are especially risky‚Äîsuch as a
 dding columns with defaults or modifying indexes‚Äîand how to spot them in

 \, including safe migration patterns\, multi-step deployment techniques\, 
 and tips for planning changes during low-traffic windows. Whether you're r

SUMMARY:The X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs of Open Source with ShotGeek
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Kudzayi Bamhare\nLocation: Wolf Point Ballroom\n\
 nDescription:\nWhat happens when your coding skills and your passions coll
 ide? Sometimes\, you get a project like ShotGeek‚Äîand a whole lot of less
 ons along the way.\n\nIn this talk\, I‚Äôll walk through the real story be
 hind ShotGeek: how casual group text arguments about NBA stats turned into
  an open-source Django application for tracking and comparing the performa
 nces of both current and retired NBA players. I‚Äôll share:\n\nHow the pro
 ject got started and how I translated a playful idea into a real Django ap
 plication.\n\nTechnical challenges I faced (like designing flexible models
  for constantly evolving data).\n\nLessons learned from encouraging commun
 ity contributions and balancing ‚Äúperfect code‚Äù with ‚Äúgood enough to 
 move forward.‚Äù\n\nInsights into what went well‚Äîand what I wish I had d
 one differently‚Äîas the project grew.\n\nHow shared passions (in my case\
 , basketball!) can create opportunities for real community and learning in
  open-source.\n\nThis talk is for anyone curious about starting a project 
 outside of work or school\, especially those wondering: "Is my idea really
  worth building?"\n\nAttendees will leave with a better understanding of:\
 n\nHow to scope a passion project realistically\n\nStrategies for inviting
  and managing community contributions.\n\nHow to navigate the inevitable t
 echnical and emotional challenges along the way.\n\nWhy joy and authentici
 ty can be powerful fuel for long-term open-source success.\n\nWhether you'
 re a seasoned developer or just starting out\, I hope to show that some of
  the most meaningful projects start with a spark of personal excitement‚Äî
 and that Django can bring those sparks to life.\n\nMore info: https://2025

SUMMARY:PostgreSQL: Tuning parameters or Tuning Queries?
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Henrietta Dombrovskaya\nLocation: Sauganash Ballr
 oom\n\nDescription:\nWhen it comes to database performance tuning\, most P
 ostgreSQL practitioners focus on optimizing configuration parameters. It i
 s often assumed that as soon as we choose the correct values for parameter
 s and restart the database instance\, all the world's problems will be sol
 ved. Indeed\, due to configuration parameters tuning\, we can observe data
 base performance increase up to 10-20% and sometimes up to 50%. That might
  sound like impressive numbers\, but individual query optimization routine
 ly makes queries run several times faster\, sometimes ten or more times fa
 ster. All of us might recall some examples of such drastic performance imp
 rovement\, but it is not easy to quantify the impact. In this talk\, we wi
 ll demonstrate the difference each approach can make with practical exampl
 es by using the Postgres_air database ( https://github.com/hettie-d/postgr
 es_air )- the largest publicly available PostgreSQL training DB. We will c
 ompare the impact of tuning different memory allocation parameters with th
 e impact of creating missing indexes and\, finally - with the impact of qu
 ery rewrite. Hopefully\, the numbers will speak for themselves.\n\nMore in

SUMMARY:Django Without Borders: A 10-Year Journey of Open Source Impact in 
 Namibia
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Ngazetungue Muheue\nLocation: Wolf Point Ballroom
 \n\nDescription:\nIn this talk\, I‚Äôll share how we built one of Africa
 ‚Äôs most impactful Python and Django communities in Namibia\, focusing on
  the strategies and challenges we overcame to create a thriving\, inclusiv
 e open-source ecosystem in a region with limited tech infrastructure. Atte
 ndees will learn howto grow a sustainable community\, empowering underrepr
 esented groups\, and using open-source tools like Django to address local 
 challenges in real-world projects.\n\nThis talk is important because it hi
 ghlights how communities in underserved regions can use open-source techno
 logies to drive change\, even without access to the infrastructure found i
 n larger tech hubs. It‚Äôs a story of resilience\, innovation\, and collab
 oration over the last 10 years of our community. This journey wasn‚Äôt jus
 t about writing code\; it was about changing the landscape of tech in Nami
 bia\, proving that with determination and the right support and tools like
  Django\, anyone can participate and contribute meaningfully. If you‚Äôre 
 someone who‚Äôs interested in creating meaningful impact with technology\,
  especially in resource-constrained environments\, this talk will provide 
 you with the lessons and strategies to do so.\n\nI will discuss the follow
 ing key points:\n\nThis talk isn‚Äôt just for developers. It‚Äôs for anyon
 e who believes in the potential of technology to uplift lives and communit
 ies\, regardless of circumstances. Whether you‚Äôre a community organizer\
 , a developer\, or someone passionate about creating change\, you‚Äôll lea
 ve this session with both the inspiration and practical insights to make a
  difference where it matters most.\n\nMore info: https://2025.djangocon.us

SUMMARY:Reverse engineering the QR code generator and URL forwarder service
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Mariatta\nLocation: Sauganash Ballroom\n\nDescrip
 tion:\nSharing urls using QR code is a common use case nowadays.\n\nYou mi
 ght have seen restaurants sharing links to their menu or loyalty programs 
 using QR code. A conference speaker might have lots of links to share duri
 ng their talk\, and it's not always practical to share long links in their
  presentation slides. Using QR code would help\, but QR code creation is a
  mysterious process.\n\nThere are various websites and services that lets 
 you generate QR codes. However\, these services sometimes aren't free\, or
  they might serve ads on the website. What's even worse\, sometimes these 
 services would mask your url with a their own url shortener or domain. Use
 rs will hesitate to scan your QR code if it is not clear where it's taking
  them to.\n\nLet's reverse engineer those services and see how we can buil
 d our own using Python and Django.\n\nYou can easily generate QR codes in 
 Python using the qrcode Python library. It even lets you customize your QR
  code by adding colors and logo.\n\nAs you generate more QR codes yourself
 \, you might find it tedious having to do it as a Python script. Wouldn't 
 it be nice if you could do it in the browser?\n\nWhat if you need to chang
 e your URL after sharing the original QR code? For example\, what if you'v
 e printed our the QR code in your promotional posters\, and flyers? It's n
 ot always cost-efficient to re-print and re-distribute your materials just
  because you have a new URL. Therefore\, you might have a need for a URL f
 orwarder service.\n\nTake your Django knowledge to the next level by build
 ing a web service for QR code generation and url forwarder/shorterner.\n\n

SUMMARY:Winemaking with Mutable Event Sourcing in Django
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Chris Muthig\nLocation: Wolf Point Ballroom\n\nDe

  domain modeling\, but its strict immutability can become a constraint in 
 domains where history needs revision. In this talk\, we‚Äôll explore how t

SUMMARY:Building maintainable Django projects: the difficult teenage years
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Alex Henman\nLocation: Wolf Point Ballroom\n\nDes
 cription:\nRather than focusing on a single theme this talk touches on a r
 ange of real-world engineering problems and patterns\, all centred around 
 the challenges that arise in a mature codebase. Topics include:\n\n1. Cros
 s-Framework Harmony with Custom Events and json_script\n\nStill stuck half
 way through migrating to your new JavaScript framework 5 years later? (Jus
 t me?) I'll demonstrate a pattern which uses custom DOM events to keep thi
 ngs loosely coupled and how json_script can transmit structured data when 
 you can't go all in on APIs.\n\n2. Customising DRF for more consistent API
 s and Observability\n\nThe Django REST Framework is powerful\, but buildin
 g standard patterns around it makes it even better. I‚Äôll show how custom
  serializer fields and base viewsets can make data access consistent and e
 nable things like automatic event tracking and monitoring endpoints.\n\n3.
  Taming Long-Running Queries with Postgres Statement Timeouts\n\nLong-runn
 ing queries can kill user experience. By setting a statement_timeout in Po
 stgres and pairing it with custom middleware and a database backend\, we t
 urn slow queries into graceful 503 responses that we can handle in the fro
 nt-end.\n\n4. Fine-Grained Permissions with Decorators and Feature Flags\n
 \nWe'll look at how we can define flexible access rules per view or endpoi
 nt and how feature flags can provide gated access to beta features for spe
 cific user segments and internal use.\n\n5. Better Logs with Middleware an
 d Request Tracing\n\nWe'll explore middleware patterns for injecting a sha
 red request_id into logs\, techniques for surfacing Django view names in n
 ginx logs\, and how to connect database monitoring to specific HTTP reques
 ts for a full trace through the stack.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre wrangling a lar
 ge project or trying to avoid turning your fresh greenfield into a mess\, 
 these tips aim to make your Django stack more predictable\, observable\, a
 nd maintainable.\n\nMore info: https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/building-ma

SUMMARY:Beyond Filters: Modern Search (and more) with Vectors in Django
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Kumar Shivendu\nLocation: Wolf Point Ballroom\n\n
 Description:\nTraditional search in Django apps\, typically powered by que
 ryset filters or keyword search\, often fails to capture user intent . It 
 matches exact words but misses meaning. Vector search solves this by repre
 senting the "meaning" of data (text\, images\, audio\, video\, etc) as hig
 h-dimensional vectors generated with ML models\, enabling more relevant\, 
 personalized\, and faster results.\n\nIn this talk\, you'll learn:\n\nThis
  session is for intermediate Django developers familiar with models\, view
 s\, and basic querying. Vector search is becoming a high demand skill so e
 veryone is welcome. But if you've built search features with filters or ke
 yword search and are curious about taking them to the next level with vect
 ors\, this talk is definitely for you!\n\nMore info: https://2025.djangoco

SUMMARY:Beyond the ORM: from Postgres to OpenSearch
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Andrew Mshar\nLocation: Sauganash Ballroom\n\nDes
 cription:\nOur team at Energy Solutions spent a year building a robust dat
 a ingestion and query pipeline using OpenSearch to provide centralized dat
 a to a distributed suite of applications. Along the way\, we learned to qu
 estion and rethink a lot of our relational database assumptions and take f
 uzzy search customization and accuracy to the next level. Meanwhile\, we i
 mplemented Pydantic wrappers around JSON responses so we could continue to
  handle responses like native Python objects (along with other benefits we
 ‚Äôll discuss). We addressed long-standing challenges\, such as:\n\nIn thi
 s presentation\, we‚Äôll walk through the decisions that led us to moving 
 to an OpenSearch-based solution that works within a traditional Django fra
 mework\, how we tackled advanced topics like token analysis\, and how we p
 ut OpenSearch aliases to work. We‚Äôll also cover some of the cost-benefit
  equations\, summarize our next phase of work in the project\, and include
  real-time demonstrations of some concepts.\n\nUtilities\, which are often
  regulated\, are responsible for generating a consistent supply of energy 
 for their consumers at a stable price. Efficiency incentive programs that 
 manage demand help insulate utilities from the costs associated with purch
 asing raw materials (coal\, gas\, etc.) and help reduce the need to build 
 new power plants that are expensive to build\, staff\, insure\, and supply
  with consumable\, non-renewable resources.\n\nUtilities are also usually 
 required by law to spend part of the budget they collect on customer bills
  on something to reduce the demand for energy in their territory. For inst
 ance\, a utility might offer a $1\,500 rebate (AKA incentive) for the sale
  of an industrial heat pump that is far more efficient than other industri
 al heat pumps\, via an energy efficiency (EE) program. By incentivizing hi
 gh efficiency equipment\, utilities help move the market towards ever more
  efficient versions of equipment\, thus locking in energy savings even aft
 er the EE programs end. In this way\, we can help utilities and their cust
 omers save energy and move the needle away from climate change.\n\nWhat Co
 smos is\, a service for our other projects to access larger datasets such 
 as locations and equipment\, and why we needed a new service.\n\nMore info

SUMMARY:Cutting latency in half: What actually worked‚Äîand what didn‚Äôt
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Timothy Mccurrach\nLocation: Wolf Point Ballroom\
 n\nDescription:\nJoin me as we dig into real-world Django performance chal
 lenges - from quick wins to stubborn bottlenecks that took multiple strate
 gies to fix. Along the way\, we‚Äôll explore how we identified what really
  needed improving - and what was a red herring. We‚Äôll walk through the c
 ode that caused the slowdowns\, and examine the performance data to learn 
 what actually made a difference.\n\nWe‚Äôll start with the often-overlooke
 d topic of profiling\, examining scenarios where our personal experience o
 f the site didn‚Äôt match what the performance metrics were telling us. We
 ‚Äôll explore common mistakes in how performance is measured and why diffe
 rent goals require different metrics. Finally\, we‚Äôll compare the streng
 ths and weaknesses of various profiling tools available - so you can bette
 r understand where your real opportunities for improvement lie.\n\nFrom th
 ere\, we‚Äôll learn what it means for querysets to be lazy\, what an N+1 i
 ssue is\, and the tools Django (and other third-party packages) provide to
  solve them. We‚Äôll explore why pagination can be slow\, look at caching 
 strategies to speed up your site\, database indexes to speed up your queri
 es\, and examine common Django-specific bottlenecks - seeing in each case 
 the difference these changes made in real life\, not just in theory.\n\nWe
 ‚Äôll also look at a few situations where the biggest improvements didn‚Äô
 t come from deep ORM knowledge or database nuances\, but from much simpler
  changes - and reflect on the lessons those experiences taught us.\n\nMayb
 e performance has always felt like a bit of a mystery to you\, or maybe yo
 u‚Äôre just curious how adding caching actually slowed our site down. Whet
 her you‚Äôre a beginner or a seasoned developer\, this talk will equip you
  with practical tools\, proven techniques\, and guiding principles to make
  your Django apps faster and more efficient.\n\nMore info: https://2025.dj

LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Kattni\nLocation: Sauganash Ballroom\n\nDescripti
 on:\nParticipating in online open source communities can be a positive exp
 erience\, but it isn't necessarily so for everyone. Stories abound of mist
 reatment of project maintainers and community contributors\, including bul
 lying\, doxing\, even acts of outright violence. But those negative experi
 ences don't have to happen! Creating a safe and welcoming environment for 
 open source development begins with you. Discover how you can affect posit
 ive change in your own project space and the spaces of others within the o
 pen source community through practical and achievable actions. You will ga
 in a better understanding of the problem\, and the changes necessary to be
 gin addressing it. Unfortunately\, there may always be those who are not i
 nterested in being a part of this solution. You will learn ways to ensure 
 you are able to take care of yourself within this reality\, while breaking
  the pattern of negativity within the spaces willing to accept a positive 
 change. You play a critical role in building and maintaining communities t
 hat are welcoming\, inclusive\, and safe. Explore how you\, and your commu
 nities\, will benefit from changing things for the better.\n\nMore info: h

SUMMARY:Python for Planet Earth: Climate Modeling and Sustainability in Act
 ion
LOCATION:Wolf Point Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Drishti Jain\nLocation: Wolf Point Ballroom\n\nDe
 scription:\nIn this talk\, I'll delve into how Python is revolutionizing c
 limate modeling and sustainability efforts. As the planet faces unpreceden
 ted environmental challenges\, the need for precise data analysis and acti
 onable insights has never been greater. Python\, with its powerful librari
 es and tools\, is at the forefront of this scientific revolution.\n\nI'll 
 begin by exploring how Python is used in climate modeling\, focusing on li
 braries like netCDF4 and xarray to handle and analyze complex climate data
 sets. Attendees will see how these tools enable scientists to simulate cli
 mate systems\, predict future scenarios\, and assess potential impacts on 
 global and regional scales.\n\nNext\, I'll shift to environmental monitori
 ng\, where Python plays a crucial role in processing and visualizing geosp
 atial data. Using tools like Rasterio \, GeoPandas \, and PyProj \, I'll d
 emonstrate how Python facilitates real-time monitoring of environmental ch
 anges\, such as deforestation\, air quality\, and ocean health.\n\nFinally
 \, I'll examine how Python supports sustainability projects\, from renewab
 le energy forecasting to resource management. By leveraging Python's data 
 analysis capabilities\, these projects are driving meaningful change in th
 e pursuit of a more sustainable future.\n\nThroughout the talk\, attendees
  will gain hands-on insights into key Python libraries\, see real-world ex
 amples of their application\, and understand how Python is empowering scie
 ntists\, researchers\, and developers to make a tangible impact on our pla
 net's future. Whether attendees are involved in environmental science\, da
 ta analysis\, or just passionate about sustainability\, this session will 
 provide you with the knowledge and tools to contribute to the cause.\n\nMo

  All\nLocation: Sauganash Ballroom\n\nDescription:\n22 years ago Django\, 
 was created in a newsroom by two programmers\, Simon Willison and Adrian H
 olovaty. Since then\, it's been downloaded millions of times and has one o
 f the most active open source communities in Python. At the same time\, th
 e software industry has changed a lot because of AI\, leaving many of us f
 eeling unsure about the future of web development. In this talk we'll look
  at some of the key ideas that made Django successful in its early days\, 
 and how we can apply them today to reimagine how we create web application
 s with AI.\n\nWe'll talk about what it means to be a perfectionist working
  with non-deterministic tools like LLMs\, how we can avoid repeating ourse
 lves in the age of stochastic parrots and experiment with some live demos.

SUMMARY:A(i) Modest Proposal
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Mario Munoz\nLocation: Sauganash Ballroom\n\nDesc
 ription:\nIn 1729\, Jonathan Swift presented an elegant and well thought-o
 ut solution to the problem of homelessness and poverty plaguing Ireland. H
 e argued that his solution would result in a much more productive and fulf
 illing society. While not many could digest the meat of his proposal\, it 
 was still effective in exposing a widening gap of social inequality and ab
 use.\n\nIs it possible that Swift's proposal can be applied within our tec
 hnosphere? Did he provide us with a recipe for success\, or at least littl
 e nuggets of wisdom to chew on?\n\nMany attending this conference may be k
 eenly aware of the dichotomy between open source and big tech. There is a 
 relationship that always seems to be at risk of imploding. Should we be en
 couraging new (and existing) engineers to participate in open source\, in 
 spite of this tenuous relationship? If this topic whets your appetite\, yo
 u'll definitely want to come to see what's cooking.\n\nMore info: https://

 iption:\nThis talk will likely have three or four major sections. Some of 
 this is subject to change when we get out to ~1 to ~2 months from the conf
 erence given changes/breakthroughs in the Python free threading world\, an
 d any additional changes that are projected to happen in Python 3.14. That
  being said\, here is the current outline:\n\nMore info: https://2025.djan

SUMMARY:Automating initial deployments with django-simple-deploy
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Eric Matthes\nLocation: Sauganash Ballroom\n\nDes
 cription:\nDeployment has been a sticking point for many Django developers
  as long as the framework has existed. With the 1.0 release of django-simp
 le-deploy \, that should no longer be the case. This release signifies a s
 table API\, and most importantly a stable platform for building plugins.\n
 \nIf you haven't seen django-simple-deploy in action\, it lets you deploy 
 a project in three steps. Assuming you have the target platform's CLI inst
 alled\, here's what that looks like:\n\nThis currently works for Platform.
 sh \, Fly.io \, and Heroku. If you want a bit more control\, you can separ
 ate out the configuration and deployment steps.\n\nThe core django-simple-
 deploy library only does a little work. It inspects your system and your p
 roject\, and then hands off to an external plugin (such as dsd-platformsh 
 ) to take care of platform-specific configuration and deployment work. It 
 should be possible to write a plugin for just about any hosting platform t
 hat can be configured to support Django.\n\nEach PAAS provider needs its o
 wn plugin. However\, a single plugin\, dsd-vps \, can be used to deploy to
  any VPS host: Digital Ocean\, Linode\, Hetzner\, and many more.\n\nThis t
 alk will discuss the following:\n\nJust about everyone in the community is
  affected by Django's deployment story. If you'd like Django to have a muc
 h simpler initial deployment story\, this talk is for you.\n\nMore info: h

SUMMARY:What a Decade!
LOCATION:Sauganash Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Timothy Allen\nLocation: Sauganash Ballroom\n\nDe
 scription:\nContent Warning : This talk will dive into addiction and loss 
 of friends due to addiction in the third section.\n\n2025 marks a decade t
 hat our team has been using Python and Django.\n\nIn the first part of the
  talk\, I will explain the process we went through to select our new web f
 ramework and language of choice. We were meticulous\, and developed a proc
 ess called DevTAP\, or Development Technology Assessment Process. We asked
  well over a hundred questions about each. What databases did the framewor
 k support? How much activity was there on Stack Overflow? What kind of CSV
  support was available? Each question was given a score of 0\, 1\, or 2: 0
  for no support\, 1 for support\, or 2 for supports and excels. We found t
 hat our existing technology was definitely outdated\, but that most of the
  frameworks we were looking at (Django\, Rails\, CodeIgniter\, .NET) all s
 hared most of the same features.\n\nIn the second part of the talk\, I'll 
 share why we were extremely lucky. While we had assessed our technology ne
 eds\, we hadn't asked the most important questions. Does this web framewor
 k community support our morals? What is the governance model for the langu
 age and framework? Is it owned by a non-profit? Does it support our belief
  that diversity\, equity\, and inclusion are mandatory features of a commu
 nity? Becoming part of the Python and Django communities forced us to ackn
 owledge that we had been asking the wrong questions\, and admit that we ha
 d gotten incredibly lucky with our choice.\n\nIn the third part\, I will t
 alk about my own journey in recovery. I attended my first PyCon US in 2015
 \, and only the final day of that conference in Montreal\, I saw Jacob Kap
 lan-Moss give a keynote. I had no idea at the time\, but that would also b
 e my first day clean and sober. Since then\, my work colleagues\, my Djang
 o family\, the Python community at large\, and my recovery family have bee
 n part of an amazing team that has filled my life with joy\, support\, kno
 wledge\, true friendship\, education\, and empathy.\n\nDjango is many thin
 gs: a community\, an ecosystem\, and a web framework. I will spend a short
  time pointing out that no LLM coding assistant will ever be able to provi
 de the most important part: the community.\n\nI'm incredibly lucky to be p
 art of some incredible communities\; to get to congregate yearly at Django
 Con US with some of my favorite humans on this rock\; to have a yearly rem
 inder that most people are good. That we don't just come together to build
  a better web framework\, we come together to build a better planet.\n\nMo
